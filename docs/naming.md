# ðŸ”  Naming Conventions for Data Warehouse Objects

This guide defines consistent naming standards across all layersâ€”Bronze, Silver, and Goldâ€”in the data warehouse. The goal is to promote clarity, reduce ambiguity, and align with best practices in data modeling.

##  Core Guidelines

* **Style:** Use `snake_case` (lowercase letters and underscores).
* **Language:** Always use English.
* **Reserved Keywords:** Avoid using SQL reserved words as object identifiers.

##  Table Naming by Layer

###  Bronze Layer

* Format: `{source}_{entity}`
* Rule: Names must begin with the originating system name and match the original source table without alteration.
* Components:

  * `source`: Abbreviation of source system (e.g., `crm`, `erp`)
  * `entity`: Exact table name from source
* Example: `crm_customer_info` â†’ Raw CRM customer data

###  Silver Layer

* Format: `{source}_{entity}`
* Rule: Follow the same conventions as Bronze. Names remain unchanged from their source.
* Example: `erp_sales_data` â†’ ERP transactional sales records

###  Gold Layer

* Format: `{role}_{subject}`
* Rule: Use business-aligned and descriptive names.
* Prefix meanings:

  * `dim_`: Dimension table
  * `fact_`: Fact table
  * `report_`: Reporting-ready aggregate or derived table
* Examples:

  * `dim_customers`: Business-level customer attributes
  * `fact_sales`: Transactional sales facts
  * `report_monthly_revenue`: Aggregated monthly revenue report

---

##  Column Naming Guidelines

###  Surrogate Keys

* Format: `{entity}_key`
* Rule: All dimension tables should have a primary surrogate key using this format.
* Example: `customer_key` â†’ Primary key in `dim_customers`

###  Technical Metadata Columns

* Format: `dwh_{metric}`
* Rule: All system-generated or operational metadata columns should start with `dwh_`
* Examples:

  * `dwh_create_date` â†’ Timestamp when data was loaded
  * `dwh_source_file` â†’ Filename or source record path

---

##  Stored Procedures

### Naming Format:

* `load_{layer}`

Where:

* `layer` = `bronze`, `silver`, or `gold`

### Examples:

* `load_bronze` â†’ Procedure to load raw data into Bronze layer
* `load_silver` â†’ Procedure to process data into Silver layer
