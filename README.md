# 🏢 SQL-Based ETL Pipeline & Analytics Architecture: CRM + ERP Integration

Welcome to the **SQL-Based ETL Pipeline & Analytics Architecture: CRM + ERP Integration** repository! 🚀
This portfolio project showcases the end-to-end implementation of a modern data warehouse and analytics solution. It highlights data engineering best practices, efficient data modeling techniques, and actionable business intelligence using SQL and visualization tools.

---

## 🧱 Data Architecture – Medallion Design

The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with three key layers:

* **🔶 Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data ingested as-is from the source systems (ERP and CRM) via CSV files into SQL Server.
* **⚪ Silver Layer**: Transforms, cleanses, and standardizes the raw data for analytical usability.
* **🔷 Gold Layer**: Final business-ready layer modeled in a **Star Schema** for reporting and analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

* **Data Architecture** using modern warehousing principles
* **ETL Pipelines** to extract, transform, and load data into SQL Server
* **Data Modeling** with Fact and Dimension tables for analytics
* **Analytics & Reporting** using SQL queries and BI dashboards to generate insights

## 🎯 Objectives

### 📦 Data Engineering Goals:

* Design and implement a scalable warehouse in SQL Server.
* Integrate data from two source systems (ERP & CRM).
* Ensure data quality through cleansing and transformation.
* Model analytical data in a star schema format.
* Document the entire pipeline and model for stakeholder usage.

### 📊 Analytics Goals:

* Derive insights on:

  * Customer behavior
  * Product performance
  * Sales trends
* Create SQL-based reports to support strategic business decisions.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Setup Database**
   Run `init_database.sql` to initialize the `DataWarehouse` and create schemas.

2. **Create Tables**
   Execute all `ddl_*.sql` scripts from each layer (`bronze`, `silver`, `gold`).

3. **Load Data**

   * Use `load_bronze.sql` to bulk load raw CSVs
   * Execute `load_silver.sql` for cleansing & transformation

4. **Explore Views**

   * The Gold layer exposes `dim_customers`, `dim_products`, and `fact_sales` views

5. **Run Tests**

   * Validate data integrity using quality checks in the `tests/` folder

---

## 📊 Sample Business Questions Answered

* Which customer segments generate the most revenue?
* What are the top-selling products by region?
* How do sales trends vary month-over-month?
* What CRM leads converted into actual purchases?

---

## 🧪 Test & Validation

To ensure accuracy and quality, the project includes:

* Null and duplicates checks
* Data type validations
* Referential integrity tests
